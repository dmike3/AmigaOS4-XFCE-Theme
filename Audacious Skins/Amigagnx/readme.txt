  OS8 AMP v1.9 - By DeeLight
 ____________________________________________________________

  I made my first OS8 AMP skin, using "The Mad Yeti" original
  OS8 AMP for Winamp 1.9x.  I changed and  retouched a lot of
  stuff in his  original skin,  and added  the Equalizer  and
  Playlist.  In version 1.5, I made  much more  improvements,
  and added a lot of new stuff.  I was inspired by some other
  "mac"  skins  for  Winamp 1.x  and the  MacAmp 98  skin for
  Winamp 2.x.  In  version 1.6,  I added  the  Mini  Browser,
  fixed some bugs and made some improvements. Version 1.8 has
  the Equalizer WindowShade mode and the Browser is fixed for
  Winamp 2.20  and a  lot  of  other  improvments.  Read  the
  history.txt for more info. Version 1.9 has just a few small
  changes:  The color of the address  in the  MiniBrowser and
  some other small improvements. Version 1.95 now has the Mac
  cursors.
